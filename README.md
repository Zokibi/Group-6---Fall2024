## Objective
We are creating a software product that allows servers and host to easily manage tables, customers and all other information about restaurant. The softwaere will improve workflow assiting with controlling wait times, table management, table assignment, and also track table status. The system will be made avaliable to the server upon clocking in to the system. This will all be done through a simple and easy to navigate user interface. Servers will be able to track table through table numbers and track what meals belong to the table through meal id's.
